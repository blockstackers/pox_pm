This repo is used to manage projects by the Proof of Transfer (PoX) working group.

## Proof of Transfer Working Group
The PoX group is working through developments in Blockstack's breakthrough, proposed consensus mechanism, Proof of Transfer, ahead of the launch of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain. Previously, this group contributed to the FAQ about PoX by examining the *Proof of Transfer Mining with Bitcoin* whitepaper and raising questions about it during a recent town hall meeting with over 100 community members in attendance. Currently, group members are researching ways for community members to combine Stacks (STX) holdings in order to earn Bitcoin through the Stacking consensus algorithm. This group is led by Production Partner at Blockstack PBC, Xan Ditkoff.
